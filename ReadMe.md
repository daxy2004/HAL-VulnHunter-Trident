# Vulnerable Web Application

This is a **deliberately vulnerable web application** designed for educational purposes. It demonstrates common web application vulnerabilities, including **SQL Injection**, **XSS**, **IDOR**, **CSRF**, and **DNS/Domain-related issues**. The application is built using **Flask** and **SQLite** and is intended to help developers and security enthusiasts understand how these vulnerabilities work and how to prevent them.

**Disclaimer**: This application is intentionally insecure. Do not deploy it in a production environment.

## Features
- **SQL Injection**: Demonstrates how unsanitized user input can lead to database manipulation.
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)**: Shows how malicious scripts can be injected into web pages.
- **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)**: Highlights the risks of exposing direct references to objects (e.g., database records).
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)**: Illustrates how attackers can trick users into performing unintended actions.
- **DNS/Domain Issues**: Demonstrates the risks of making uncontrolled requests to external domains.

---

## Prerequisites
Before setting up the project, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.9 or later**
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Flask** (will be installed during setup)

---

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/vulnerable-app.git
   cd vulnerable-app
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment**:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Initialize the Database**:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "from app.database import init_db; init_db()"
   ```

---

## Running the Application

1. **Start the Flask Development Server**:
   ```bash
   export FLASK_APP=app
   export FLASK_ENV=development
   flask run
   ```

2. **Access the Application**:
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

---

## Testing Vulnerabilities

### SQL Injection
1. Go to the search page:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/search?q=test
   ```
2. Inject a malicious SQL payload:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/search?q=' OR '1'='1
   ```
3. **Expected Result**: All products are displayed, regardless of the search term.

---

### XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)
1. Go to the search page:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/search?q=test
   ```
2. Inject a JavaScript payload:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/search?q=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
   ```
3. **Expected Result**: A JavaScript alert box appears with the message "XSS".

---

### IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference)
1. Go to the profile page for user 1:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/profile/1
   ```
2. Change the `user_id` parameter to access other users' profiles:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/profile/2
   ```
3. **Expected Result**: The profile of user 2 is displayed (if it exists).

---

### CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)
1. Create a malicious HTML file (`csrf.html`) with the following content:
   ```html
   <!DOCTYPE html>
   <html>
   <body>
       <h1>CSRF Attack</h1>
       <form action="http://127.0.0.1:5000/update_profile" method="POST">
           <input type="hidden" name="user_id" value="1">
           <input type="hidden" name="name" value="Hacked">
           <button type="submit">Submit</button>
       </form>
   </body>
   </html>
   ```
2. Open the file in your browser and click "Submit".
3. **Expected Result**: The profile of user 1 is updated to have the name "Hacked".

---

### DNS/Domain Issues
1. Go to the `fetch_data` endpoint:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000/fetch_data?domain=example.com
   ```
2. **Expected Result**: The application makes a request to `http://example.com/data` and returns the response.

---

## Security Notes
- **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries to prevent SQL Injection.
- **XSS**: Sanitize user input and escape output using Flask's `escape` function.
- **IDOR**: Implement proper authorization checks to ensure users can only access their own data.
- **CSRF**: Use CSRF tokens to validate requests.
- **DNS/Domain Issues**: Restrict requests to trusted domains.
